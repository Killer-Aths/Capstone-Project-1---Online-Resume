                <h3>DormGuard : A Digital Hostel Attendance System</h3>
                <p>
                    DormGuard revolutionizes hostel management with its cutting-edge attendance tracking system. 
                    Leveraging RFID technology, DormGuard digitally registers students' in-time and out-time, 
                    eliminating manual data entry.Traditional attendance systems rely on manual data recording, 
                    leading to inefficiencies. DormGuard streamlines this process, reducing repetitive tasks and 
                    minimizing entry/exit queues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to efficiently manage hostel attendance while contributing to environmental 
                    sustainability by eliminating paper waste. DormGuard exemplifies innovation in hostel management, 
                    offering a professional, efficient, and environmentally friendly solution aligned with modern 
                    technological trends.

                <h3>A REVIEW ON IMAGE COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES</h3>
                <p>
                    This paper presents an extensive review of various image types and the diverse techniques 
                    utilized in image compression. Our thorough examination culminates in the proposal of a 
                    generalized method for image compression, focusing on reducing image size while preserving 
                    image quality.Image compression plays a pivotal role in facilitating the efficient transmission 
                    and storage of vast amounts of digital image data. Its applications span across diverse domains 
                    such as television broadcasting, satellite-based remote sensing, and long-distance communication. 
                    Simultaneously, effective image storage is crucial for preserving critical data including medical 
                    images, satellite imagery, documents, and personal photographs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this study, we delve into different image types and explore a range of compression techniques 
                    to address the multifaceted challenges associated with the transmission and storage of digital 
                    images. Notably, we demonstrate two fundamental approaches: lossless compression technique 
                    employing Huffman coding, and lossy compression technique employing Block Truncation Coding.
                    Through our investigation, we aim to contribute to the advancement of image compression 
                    methodologies, paving the way for more efficient utilization of digital resources in various 
                    fields.
