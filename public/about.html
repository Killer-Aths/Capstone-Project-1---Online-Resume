                Hi there! I'm Atharva, a curious mind hailing from the vibrant city of Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra. 
                Currently, I'm immersed in the dynamic world of technology as I pursue my B.Tech in Computer Science 
                and Engineering at the esteemed Indian Institute of Information Technology Vadodara.
            </p>
            <p>
                Academics have always been my forte, but my thirst for knowledge extends far beyond the classroom walls. 
                I'm an avid explorer of various domains, constantly delving into new fields to broaden my horizons. 
                From delving into the intricacies of IoT and embedded systems to diving headfirst into app development
                and the realms of UI-UX design, I've embraced each opportunity to learn and grow. Currently, I find 
                myself captivated by the intricacies of web development, eager to unravel its mysteries and harness 
                its potential.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the realm of technology, I'm just your average guy with a penchant for simple pleasures. 
                You'll often find me engrossed in PC games like Valorant, CS: GO, and GTA V, or battling it out 
                in mobile favorites like Clash of Clans and Clash Royale. When the digital world loses its allure, 
                I'm out on the field, relishing a game of cricket or cycling through scenic routes. Weekends are 
                reserved for unwinding with friends, embarking on midnight escapades through the city streets on our 
                trusty bikes. And yes, I'll admit, I have a guilty pleasure—indulging in endless scrolls through 
                Instagram reels, a perfect escape from the daily grind.
            </p>
            <p>
                In essence, I'm a curious soul driven by a passion for learning and a zest for life's 
                simple pleasures. Join me on this journey of exploration and discovery as we navigate 
                the ever-evolving landscape of technology and beyond.
